                <p>Traveling to an international country becomes a whole lot easier when you have an English-speaking private walking guide by your side.

Yeah, that’s the kind of Paris experience we are talking about.</p>
                <p>At <strong>Scenic Zest</strong>, all of our tour guides are fully licensed where needed. That means you are getting trusted, accurate information and in many cases, quicker entry with special access. You are not just getting a tour guide.

                <h2>Best Places for Your Private Walking Tour in Paris</h2>
                <p>Paris offers endless ways to explore. The real beauty of a private tour is its flexibility. You can shape the experience around your interests, your pace, and your schedule. Below are some of the most popular private walking tours that travelers love, which we can arrange for you:</p>
                
                <h3>Montmartre Private Walking Tour</h3>
                <p>This is Paris at its most artistic. On this Montmartre tour, your English-speaking guide walks you through the neighborhood once home to Van Gogh, Picasso, and Toulouse-Lautrec. You will pass by the Moulin Rouge, see Dalida’s house, snap a photo at the famous "I Love You Wall", and end at Sacré-Cœur Basilica for one of the best panoramic views in the city.</p>

                <h3>Notre-Dame & Sainte-Chapelle Private Walking Tour</h3>
                <p>You will begin on Île de la Cité, right in the historic center of the city where Paris first began. With a local English-speaking guide, you will explore the area around the Notre-Dame Cathedral. Learn about its incredible Gothic architecture, and get the real story behind the restoration after the fire. With our guide, you will skip the line and head inside Sainte-Chapelle. The walls are made almost entirely of stained glass, and when the sun shines through, it feels like standing inside a jewel box.</p>
